# Natural Earth

Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. 

## Description

Because the Natural Earth dataset is quite extensive, only a selection of the layers from the 1:10m version are currently available in PostGIS Baselayers. The dataset uses the `naturalearth` schema in the database, with the tables described below.

### ne_10m_admin_0_countries

Simple layer of countries at the Admin 0 level. Column `geom` contains the geometry, and `name` the common name of the country. Also includes various other data fields such as population, abbreviations, GDP estimates, and names in various other languages.

### ne_10m_admin_1_states_provinces

Contains level 1 adminitrative subdivisions such as states and provinces. Column `geom` contains the geometry and `name` contains the name of the division. Various other fields are also available.

### ne_10m_populated_places

Contains point locations of populated places. Column `geom` contains the geometry, and `name` contains the name of the place. Various other fields also included.

### ne_10m_lakes

Contains global lakes and reservoirs, including the Europe and North America supplements. Column `geom` contains the geometry, `featurecla` is a feature class to differentiate between lakes and reservoirs, and `name` contains the name of the feature.

### ne_10m_rivers

Contains global rivers and lakes centerlines, including the Europe and North America supplements. Column `geom` contains the geometry, and `name` contains the common name of the feature.

## Examples

### Make a list of rivers in Poland

Query:

    SELECT 
        DISTINCT ne_10m_rivers.name
    FROM 
        naturalearth.ne_10m_admin_0_countries, 
        naturalearth.ne_10m_rivers 
    WHERE 
        ne_10m_admin_0_countries.name = 'Poland' AND 
		ne_10m_rivers.name != '' AND
        ST_Intersects(
            ne_10m_admin_0_countries.geom,
            ne_10m_rivers.geom
        ) 
    ORDER BY

### Find the largest reservoirs in the State of California

Query:

    SELECT
